# bloc_api_flutter

A Flutter project using bloc pattern.

## Getting Started

This project is an exercise.

The objective is to consume a simple api, get all data, and provide it in the application.
Bloc pattern it's based in the idea of using events to trigger modifications in states.
This example shows how occurs the association between events and states.
When a initial state starts, the application is initiated with initial state. To change this state
another event is called by an action in UI(a button click in this case), and the new state is started,
loading the data.
